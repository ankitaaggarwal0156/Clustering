# Clustering
K-means and GMM

Implement the K-means algorithm AND the Expectation Maximization algorithm for clustering using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
Run your algorithms on the data file "clusters.txt" using K, the number of clusters, set to 3. 
Report the centroid of each cluster in K-means; and report the mean, amplitude and covariance matrix of each Gaussian in GMM.
The data file contains 150 2D points. Each row in the file contains the coordinates of a single point.
